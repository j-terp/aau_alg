Real life problem, formulizes as a computational problem, that can be solved with algorithms. The code can afterwards be implemented, compiled and being run.
Understanding computational problem and how to formulize it from a real problem.
Analysis, defined, correctness, efficiency. Ideas and patterns in design of algorithms.

# What are Algorithms

- Well-defined computation procedure, takes input, manipulates these and transform into an output.
- A tool to solve a specified problem, desired input and output specified and not ambiguous.

- A problem can be solved in different ways, therefore there can be multiple correct algorithms solving the same problem.

- An algorithm is correct if for every input halts with correct output. We say correct algorithms solves the given computational problem.

## Describing Algorithms

- How to present algorithms formally, usually is in pseudocode. It allows freedom in describing the algorithm.
